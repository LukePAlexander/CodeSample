Hello! 

Thank you for looking at my repository, this is where I'll be saving bits of code that I've worked on for other people to possibly use or draw from. Everything is an opportunity to learn! 

For a bit of context:

I am currently working on Psyche, from Jan 2019 - now. It's a fixed perspective 3D shooter in which
your attacks and abilities change as your character goes insane or reclaims their sanity.
I have been the largest contributer to this project, almost the only engineer contributing to this project.
I am immensely proud of the results and progress I have made within this project. I'm currently most
proud of the various managers, animators, and controllers that make up the player class, it was first
based on the thirdpersoncontroller as part of Unity3D assets but I have adapted it greatly. I'm also 
proud of the homemade AI that makes up our opposing force, and the various attacks that both our 
protagonist and our enemies will be using.

ForestBelow was written from Aug 2017- March 2018.
My largest contributions were the save script and the world manager. I made contributions to most of the
codebase and was eventually hand picked to refactor the entire project but I don't feel like those parts
were reflective of my own code. 

Toggle was even earlier than that, finished around May 2017.
Within this project I was the lead of 3 engineers as well as directly writing a large portion of the scripts.
This was my first real project and I feel it had some learning curve but was a solid start. 

Snake was a server client experiment in which I pair programmed with another engineer. 
This was completed in 2016 and was pretty fun to play.

Apart from games I also had some coding projects unrelated to games. You can find these in NotGameCode.

The interactive speadsheet was a four man project about multiple client collaboration using TCP protocol 
communication. Upon ending it was functional except for a race condition when multiple clients wished to modify
the same cell while communications were interrupted.
