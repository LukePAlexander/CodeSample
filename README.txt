Hello! 

Thank you for looking at my repository, this is where I'll be keeping code that I've written or largely
contributed to for people to check up on the quality of my work.

For a bit of context ForestBelow was written from Aug 2017- March 2018.
My largest contributions were the save script and the world manager. I made contributions to most of the
codebase and was eventually hand picked to refactor the entire project but I don't feel like those parts
were reflective of my own code. 

Toggle was even earlier than that, finished around May 2017.
Within this project I was the lead of 3 engineers as well as directly writing a large portion of the scripts.
This was my first real project and I feel it had some learning curve but was a solid start. 


Apart from games I also had some coding projects unrelated to games. You can find these in NotGameCode.

The interactive speadsheet was a four man project about multiple client collaboration using TCP protocol 
communication. Upon ending it was functional except for a race condition when multiple clients wished to modify
the same cell while communications were interrupted.
